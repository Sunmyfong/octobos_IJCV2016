Description:
-----

OCTOBOS is a formulation and an algorithm that adaptively learns a structured overcomplete sparsifying transform with block cosparsity, or equivalently a union of square sparsifying transforms, and simultaneously clusters the data via sparse coding.

The OCTOBOS package includes (1) a collection of the SALT Matlab functions, and (2) example demo data used in the OCOTOBOS paper including image denoising, reconstruction, and texture segmentation.
